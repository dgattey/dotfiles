# dotfiles

Dotfiles for me, for syncing across computers!

## Installation

Most of this is just zsh config files, plus some brew packages/etc.

1. Install `zprezto` itself via https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto
1. Replace the contents of `zprezto/runcoms` folder with the `.z*` files as needed
1. Copy `.p10k.zsh` and the other dotfiles/contents of the folders in `dotfiles` to `~/`
1. Copy the contents of `xcode/UserData/FontsAndColorThemes` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontsAndColorThemes`
